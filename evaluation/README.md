# Evaluation

This folder contains all scripts to calculate and reproduce the results in the paper.

## Steps
- Decompress `data.7z` in the current folder (without any sub-folders).
- Run each scripts.

**Due to the limited space in Github, we cannot upload all collected data. Thus `10-api.py` and `12-api-track.py` cannot be executed currently because of missing files.**
